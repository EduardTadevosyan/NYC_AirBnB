# üóΩ Airbnb NYC 2019 - SQL & Power BI Project

This project is a SQL and Power BI analysis of the Airbnb NYC 2019 dataset. I chose this dataset because I love New York City, and I wanted to practice SQL and Power BI together while uncovering interesting insights about the city‚Äôs rental landscape.

ALTER TABLE NY_HOUSES2 MODIFY Last_review DATE;

-- 3. Number of rows
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM NY_HOUSES2;
-- Screenshot: ./images/raw_count.png

ORDER BY Last_review DESC 
LIMIT 1;
-- Screenshot: ./images/The_most_recent_review.png

FROM NY_HOUSES2 
ORDER BY Price DESC
LIMIT 1;
-- Screenshot: ./images/The_most_expensive_listing.png

-- 7. Cheapest listing (excluding free/invalid ones)
SELECT Price AS 'The cheapest listing'
FROM NY_HOUSES2 
WHERE Price != 0
ORDER BY Price ASC
LIMIT 1;
-- Screenshot: ./images/the_cheapest_lesting.png

-- 8. Disable safe update mode (to allow updates)
SHOW INDEX FROM NY_HOUSES2;
SET SQL_SAFE_UPDATES = 0;

-- 9. Change listing title from 'ENJOY Downtown NYC!' to 'Downtown NYC!'
UPDATE NY_HOUSES2
SET TITLE = 'Downtown NYC!'
WHERE ID = 12192;

-- 10. Confirm the change was successful
SELECT Title FROM NY_HOUSES2 
WHERE ID = 12192;
-- Screenshot: ./images/Title_Downtown_NYC.png

-- 11. Delete listing with ID = 2595
DELETE FROM NY_HOUSES2
WHERE ID = 2595;

-- 12. Listings marked as 'Manhattan' or 'Other'
SELECT TITLE,
    CASE
        WHEN Neighbourhood_group = 'Manhattan' THEN 'Manhattan'
        ELSE 'Other'
    END AS Mark
FROM NY_HOUSES2;
-- Screenshot: ./images/Listings_in_Manhattan_or_other.png

-- 13. Borough-level stats: total listings, average price, and availability
SELECT 
    neighbourhood_group, 
    COUNT(id) AS total_listings, 
    ROUND(AVG(price)) AS avg_price, 
    ROUND(AVG(availability_365)) AS avg_availability
FROM NY_HOUSES2
GROUP BY neighbourhood_group
ORDER BY total_listings DESC;
